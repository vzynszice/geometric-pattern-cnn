# Geometric-pattern-cnn
This project was prepared within the scope of the BLM3510-Artificial Intelligence course given in Yıldız Technical University Computer Engineering.

## 🎯 Project Summary

A comprehensive deep learning project that solves 5 different geometric problems defined in 25x25 binary matrices using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). The project includes a complete machine learning pipeline from data generation to model evaluation.

## 📊 Solved Problems

1. **Problem A**: Calculating Euclidean distance between two points
2. **Problem B**: Finding minimum distance between multiple points
3. **Problem C**: Finding maximum distance between multiple points
4. **Problem D**: Estimating total number of points in matrix
5. **Problem E**: Estimating number of overlapping squares

## 🚀 Achievements

- Designed customized CNN architectures for each problem
- Systematic hyperparameter optimization was performed with 25 trials
- Average MAE values ​​below 0.5 were obtained in distance problems
- 85%+ accuracy rate was achieved in counting problems

## 📈 Results

For detailed results and analysis, you can review the notebook. Model performances and visualizations are located in the training_results/ folder.

## 🛠️ Technologies

- Python 3.9+
- TensorFlow 2.12
- NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook

## 📌 Important Notes

### Data and Model Files
There are no `data/` and `models/` folders in this repository. Reasons for this:
- Model files are large and have not been uploaded to GitHub
- These folders will be created automatically when you run the notebook
- Data can be reproduced with functions in the notebook

To run the project:
1. Open the notebook and run the cells in order
2. Data generation functions will automatically create the `data/` folder
3. The `models/` folder will be created during model training
